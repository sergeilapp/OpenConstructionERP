"""v3102 — Round 5 multi-head merge.

Round 5 introduced 10 module-scoped migrations across three parallel
revision tiers (v3099/v3100/v3101). Each module branched off v3098
independently to avoid serialising the per-module audit waves; the
post-chain head set looks like this:

    v3101_carbon   (from v3100_sched ← v3099_subm ← v3099_rfi ← v3099_eac)
    v3101_crm      (from v3100_sched)
    v3101_qms      (from v3100_sched)
    v3101_svc      (from v3100_sched)
    v3101_var      (from v3100_sched)

This file consolidates all five heads into a single linear head so
``alembic upgrade head`` is deterministic on fresh installs and the
production VPS stays single-trunk.

Pure merge — no schema changes.
