"""‌⁠‍Local SQLite cleanup — delete QA / test cruft, keep deeply-worked demos.

Why this exists
---------------
``BUG-D02`` and ``BUG-USERS-POLLUTION`` from the v2.5.0 QA report describe
the same root cause: ``~/.openestimate/openestimate.db`` (and the dev
copy at ``backend/openestimate.db``) accumulates rows from every install,
test run, and `make seed` invocation. After a few months the DB has
hundreds of "Test Project ...", "CrossMod Project ...", "Smoke Test ..."
rows that obscure the actual seeded demo content.

This script identifies those cruft rows by name pattern, walks every
table with a ``project_id`` foreign key, and deletes the matched rows
together with their children. It defaults to **dry-run** — it prints
what would be deleted, takes no action, and exits 0. Pass ``--execute``
to actually perform the deletes (a backup is taken automatically).

Safety properties
-----------------
* **Default is dry-run.** No row is touched unless ``--execute`` is set.
* **Backup before delete.** A timestamped copy of the DB file is created
  in the same directory.
* **Three categories.** ``KEEP``, ``DELETE``, ``UNCERTAIN``. Uncertain
  rows are NOT deleted by default; pass ``--include-uncertain`` to fold
  them into the delete batch (after reviewing the dry-run output).
* **Cascade by hand.** SQLite's ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` is only honoured
  when ``PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`` is set per-connection — and many of
  our project_id columns don't even have an FK constraint declared.
  This script enumerates every table with a ``project_id`` column and
  deletes from each one in dependency order.
* **BOQ children.** For each surviving BOQ row, position, section,
  markup, snapshot, and activity-log rows are also cleaned. Activity
  logs are a separate FK target (``boq_id``) that wouldn't be reached
  by deleting just the project.

Patterns
--------
The blacklist is conservative. It only matches names that are obvious
QA / test artefacts:

* ``Test Project ...``
* ``CrossMod Project ...``
* ``Smoke Test ...``
* ``Schedule Test``
* ``BOQ Test``
* ``BIMPre Project ...``
* ``ReqBIM Project ...``
* ``Regression Project ...``
* ``ExcelQuality ...``
* ``Export Integrity ...``
* ``TenderingSmoke``
* ``Unified Markups E2E``
* ``DWG Debug``
* ``CDE Audit Project ...``
* ``Audit Probe Project``
* literal ``test``
* ``CSV Injection Project ...`` (Task #238 — agent test cruft)
* ``Cycle Test ...`` (Task #238)
* ``XSS Storage ...`` (Task #238)
* ``Import Safety Project ...`` (Task #238)
* ``Module Routes Project ...`` (Task #238)
* ``Mitte Tower Phase 1`` (Task #238 — duplicate-seed cruft)

Anything else (including the deeply-worked demos like *Wohnpark
Friedrichshain — Berlin*, *Boylston Crossing — Boston Mixed-Use*,
*Residencial Salamanca — Madrid*, *Residencial Vila Madalena — São
Paulo*, *Library Center*, *Portland Technical School*, *Downtown
Medical Center*) is treated as a keeper unless the operator says
otherwise.

Usage
-----

    # Dry-run (default) — prints what would happen
    python -m app.scripts.cleanup_local_db --db backend/openestimate.db

    # Actually delete + backup
    python -m app.scripts.cleanup_local_db --db backend/openestimate.db --execute

    # Add ``--include-uncertain`` to also delete unidentified single-name
    # projects that didn't match a known good pattern.
