"""Working-days calendar engine - Wave 28 of the worldwide-parameterisation audit.

Provides:
    is_working_day(date, country_code) -> bool
    next_working_day(date, country_code) -> date

Per-country rules are defined inline (public holidays and working weeks) and
drawn from the regional-pack ``holidays`` config keys.

Easter computation uses ``dateutil.easter`` (already a project dependency).
Hijri (Islamic) holidays use the maintained ``hijridate`` library to convert
Eid al-Fitr (1 Shawwal) and Eid al-Adha (10 Dhu al-Hijjah) to Gregorian for
any requested year.  Japanese equinoxes use the standard integer
approximation valid for 1980-2099.  Hindu holidays (Diwali, Holi) have no
reliable lightweight panchang library, so they are served from a curated
multi-year lookup table; years outside the table skip those holidays rather
than crash.  Carnaval (Brazil) is derived from Easter.
