"""Discover partner packs - via pip entry-points and via the repo ``packs/`` dir.

A partner pack registers via the entry-point group
``openconstructionerp.partner_packs``::

    [project.entry-points."openconstructionerp.partner_packs"]
    batimatech-ca = "openconstructionerp_batimatech_ca:MANIFEST"

The value must point at a module-level attribute that is either:
  * a ``PartnerPackManifest`` instance, OR
  * a ``dict`` the loader coerces into one.

In addition to pip-installed packs, ``discover_packs()`` also scans the
monorepo ``packs/`` directory so that source-checkout packs are listable on
the /modules page WITHOUT being pip-installed. Filesystem-discovered packs are
listable but are NEVER auto-activated - only an explicit ``OE_PARTNER_PACK``
env var activates a pack (see ``get_active_pack``).

At boot, ``discover_packs()`` enumerates every source. ``get_active_pack()``
picks one based on the precedence:

  1. env var ``OE_PARTNER_PACK`` (matches manifest.slug)
  2. None  - the platform runs in vanilla OCERP mode
