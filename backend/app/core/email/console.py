"""‌⁠‍Console email backend — logs structured records instead of sending.

Purpose: zero-config default for local development.  A fresh checkout
runs without MSA credentials, but developers still need to see *what*
the app would have sent (subject, recipient, body preview) so they can
test password-reset and notification flows without a real SMTP server.

The backend is also a useful fallback in production for environments
where outbound SMTP is intentionally disabled (air-gapped installs,
compliance freezes) — operators see every attempted send in the app log
instead of a silent no-op.
