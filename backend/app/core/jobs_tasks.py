"""‌⁠‍Celery task definitions — RFC 34 §4 W0.1.

There is exactly one task: ``oe.dispatch_job``. Module-specific work
attaches via :func:`app.core.job_runner.register_handler`, NOT via
``@celery_app.task``. This keeps the worker entry point a single,
small, well-tested generic dispatcher.

The dispatcher loads the JobRun by id, looks up the handler registered
for ``JobRun.kind``, and invokes the lifecycle helpers in
:mod:`app.core.job_runner`. All persistence runs through SQLAlchemy
async sessions; the task body itself stays sync (Celery's contract)
and uses ``asyncio.run`` to bridge.
