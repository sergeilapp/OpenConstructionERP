"""Client-error sink API routes.

Endpoints:
    POST /                         — accept an anonymised client error report

The endpoint is intentionally write-only and unauthenticated so that
anonymous landing-page or marketing-site errors can still be captured.
A per-IP rate limit at 30 req/min (sliding window) keeps the surface
safe from abuse without introducing a Redis dependency.

Storage is a v4.3 follow-up — for now we forward the payload to the
standard ``logging`` pipeline at WARNING level so it shows up next to
backend errors in journald / log aggregators.
