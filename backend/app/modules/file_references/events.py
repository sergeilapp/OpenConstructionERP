"""File-references event handlers - orphan cleanup.

Subscribes to ``documents.document.deleted`` and purges the
``oe_file_reference`` rows that point at the now-deleted document, so
cross-entity links (RFI -> drawing, task -> photo, ...) never dangle to a
file that no longer exists.

This module is auto-imported by the module loader when the
``oe_file_references`` module is loaded (see ``module_loader._load_module``
-> ``events.py``).
