    # Missing permission: boq.update". The RBAC regression originally
    # tracked as issue #101 only patched create; this completes that fix.

    # Project ownership / membership is enforced by the service layer, so
    # a viewer can still only edit BOQs in projects they own or are
    # invited to. Bulk import and delete remain editor-gated because the
    # blast radius is much higher than a per-row edit.
