# Mount the OpenCDE BCF-API 3.0 REST surface as a sub-router of the
# module's main router (eventually served at ``/api/v1/bcf/3.0/...``).
#
# The module loader (re-)imports ``router.py`` to attach it to the app,
# so we install a one-shot import hook that injects the OpenCDE routes
# into the main router AT THE END of ``router.py``'s execution - that
# way they survive the loader's reload and end up in the FastAPI app
# alongside the file-based BCF endpoints.
