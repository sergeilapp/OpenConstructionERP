"""‌⁠‍Compliance rule packs for contract gates.

A *rule pack* is a jurisdiction-scoped bundle of validation rule-SET ids
(the same set names the core :class:`ValidationEngine` already knows -
``boq_quality``, ``din276``, ``gaeb``, ``nrm``, ``masterformat`` …). Each
pack also declares which workflow gates enforce it (currently only
``contract_signature``).

These packs are deterministic seed data, not user-authored DSL - they map a
project's region to a concrete, runnable set of validation rules so the
compliance gate that runs on a contract ``draft → active`` transition has
something real to execute. A project picks which packs it enforces via the
``Project.compliance_rule_packs`` JSON column; the gate resolves the union
of every pack's ``rule_sets`` and feeds them to the validation engine.

Design choices:
    * ``rule_sets`` reference rule sets that genuinely exist in the engine's
      registry. Unknown set names are simply skipped by the engine
      (``get_rules_for_sets`` ignores them), so a pack can declare an
      aspirational set without crashing - but the shipped packs only list
      sets we actually register, so the gate always evaluates real rules.
    * The ``universal`` pack is the safe default for any project with no
      region match - it enforces the cross-market ``boq_quality`` rule set.
    * Region → pack auto-mapping is a *suggestion*; projects can override.
