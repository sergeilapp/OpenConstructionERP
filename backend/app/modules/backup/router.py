"""‌⁠‍Backup & Restore API.

Endpoints:
    POST /export    -- Download a ZIP backup of all user data
    POST /restore   -- Upload and restore from a backup ZIP
    POST /validate  -- Validate a backup ZIP without importing

BUG-018: ``POST /export/`` previously returned ``Content-Length: 0`` when
the request had a JSON body. The handler did not declare a body
parameter (so the OpenAPI surface was empty and the bug looked like
"endpoint is a stub"), and it returned ``StreamingResponse`` over an
``io.BytesIO`` - a combination that interacts badly with
``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` when the request also carries a body. The fix
moves the build-the-archive logic into ``service.build_backup`` (which
streams into a ``tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile``) and exposes a typed
``ExportRequest`` body so the OpenAPI doc actually documents the API.
