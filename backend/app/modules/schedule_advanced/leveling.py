"""‌⁠‍Resource leveling - serial-greedy heuristic (Slice 1).

Given a CPM-scheduled network and a per-resource ceiling, shift activity
start times forward (never backward) so that at no point in time the
aggregate demand for any resource exceeds its ceiling.

Priority rule (the only one shipped in Slice 1):
    1. Latest-Start ascending (LS asc) - items that MUST start sooner
       win the tie-break.
    2. Total-float ascending - critical activities (float=0) preferred
       over slack-rich ones.
    3. Activity id (string-sorted) - final deterministic tie-break so the
       algorithm is reproducible across runs / OSes.

Returns a dict ``{activity_id: new_es}`` - only includes activities
whose ES changed. Callers can re-run :func:`cpm.compute_cpm` over a
network rebuilt from the shifted activities if they need ES/EF/LS/LF
re-derived after leveling.

TODO(Slice 2): parallel SGS, splittable activities, contiguous-day
resource calendars, multi-resource priority composites.
