"""‌⁠‍Saved Views module.

A record-level, no-code saved-search engine. A user saves a named filter spec
against any entity a module has registered as searchable, then runs it as a
paginated list, a count for a reminder badge, a dashboard tile, or an export. The
engine compiles every saved spec into one parameterized SQLAlchemy ``select()``
bounded, without exception, by three server-side gates: the scoper (which rows
you may see), the column whitelist (which columns exist), and the result budget
(how much work the query may do).
