"""Reusable project-membership access helpers.

Every module that needs to gate access behind team membership (projects,
BOQ, HSE, Carbon, Variations, …) should route through these helpers rather
than inlining a fresh copy of the TeamMembership query.

Two helpers are provided:

* :func:`is_project_member` — async boolean check used in route guards.
* :func:`member_project_ids_subquery` — synchronous scalar subquery used
  in ORM ``WHERE … IN (…)`` clauses for list/aggregate endpoints.
