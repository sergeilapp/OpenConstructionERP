"""‌⁠‍In-memory pub/sub for the collaboration-locks WebSocket.

Each client subscribes with a ``(entity_type, entity_id)`` key plus its
own user identity.  When the service layer publishes a lock event, the
router looks up every socket subscribed to the same key and broadcasts
a JSON envelope.

Design choices
--------------

* **Pure asyncio / stdlib.**  No Redis, no Celery, no message broker.
  Single-worker deployments get full real-time fan-out; multi-worker
  deployments get DB-serialised locks (still correct) but presence
  events are worker-local.  The v2 plan upgrades this to Postgres
  ``LISTEN/NOTIFY`` without touching callers.

* **Per-key lock, not a single global lock.**  The hub is
  write-heavy on a handful of entities during an active session, so
  we keep a small ``asyncio.Lock`` per key and avoid serialising
  unrelated subscribers.

* **Dead-socket scrub on every broadcast.**  If a client tab is
  closed without a graceful close frame, ``send_json`` raises; we
  catch it and quietly drop the socket from the key set so a handful
  of stale tabs cannot leak memory.
