"""Estimate Reviewer - audits an EXISTING BOQ for pricing gaps and quality issues.

The user supplies a ``boq_id`` in the prompt; the agent reviews that BOQ and
reports concrete quality problems. It NEVER writes or mutates anything - it is a
read-only auditor over real project data.

Tools (declarative - wired into the global registry on import):

* ``read_boq(boq_id)``          - loads the BOQ and its positions via the real
                                  ``boq.service.BOQService.get_boq_with_positions``
                                  (the same canonical totals the BOQ detail
                                  endpoint serves, markups included). Returns a
                                  compact, token-bounded summary with the
                                  per-currency grand total.
* ``check_boq_quality(boq_id)`` - runs the platform's real
                                  :data:`validation_engine` over the
                                  ``boq_quality`` rule set (the exact rules the
                                  ``POST /boq/{id}/validate`` endpoint fires:
                                  missing/zero quantity & rate, duplicate
                                  ordinals, total mismatch, unrealistic/outlier
                                  rates, empty unit, negative values …) and
                                  returns the failing findings as a structured
                                  list grouped for the LLM.

Data integrity (no-stubs rule): both tools read REAL rows. If no DB session can
be opened in the current process (e.g. a unit test instantiating a tool
directly) the tool returns an explicit ``{"error": "unavailable", ...}``
observation so the LLM can never invent positions, rates, or findings. Money is
carried with its ISO 4217 currency code and is never blended across currencies.
