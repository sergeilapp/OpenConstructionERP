"""Regression test: pool_size/max_overflow honoured for SQLite too.

Before v2.6.40, ``create_engine_from_settings`` skipped pool sizing on the
SQLite branch (``# SQLite doesn't support pool_size/max_overflow``).
That comment was wrong: ``aiosqlite`` does honour pool sizing, and the
default ``AsyncAdaptedQueuePool`` of size=5+overflow=10 was exhausting
under parallel load (parallel QA crawlers, multi-tab clients, scheduled
jobs running concurrently).

This test verifies — by source inspection, not by spinning up an engine —
that the new code path applies pool kwargs unconditionally for both
SQLite and Postgres URLs.
