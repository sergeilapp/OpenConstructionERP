/**
 * CountryFlagBackdrop - a huge, barely-there flag watermark for pages scoped
 * to a selected country cost database (founder request 2026-06-06: pick the
 * German database and the page background carries a faint German flag).
 *
 * Composition contract: the page root adds `relative` and renders this as its
 * FIRST child. Deliberately NO z-index and NO `isolate` on the page root - a
 * per-page stacking context traps fixed z-50 modals under the sticky header
 * (modal_relative_isolate_trap). The wash paints at ~5% opacity and stays
 * non-interactive (pointer-events-none); fixed overlays still win.
 *
 * Accepts raw region keys ("DE_BERLIN", "USA_USD") or ISO codes ("de") - the
 * underlying CountryFlag resolves both. Renders nothing when no country is
 * selected, so pages can pass their state straight through.
