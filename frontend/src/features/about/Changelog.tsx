/**
 * Changelog: compact two-column release log on the /about page.
 *
 * Each entry is a single glass-style card with version, date, a short summary
 * line, and an optional tag badge. The card list is rendered as CSS columns
 * (`columns-1 md:columns-2`) so entries of variable height pack into the
 * shorter column automatically. There is no need to manually balance the
 * two columns, and a single tall summary doesn't leave the other side blank.
 *
 * Source-of-truth: a single hard-coded `CHANGELOG` array (see below). Entries
 * are kept short and plain per the user's request. The full prose lives in
 * repo-root CHANGELOG.md.

  { version: '7.5.0', date: '2026-06-10', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'The takeoff Recognize tool now reads scanned drawings that have no vector layer, finding room outlines and wall lines in the image so a paper scan returns usable measurements instead of nothing. You can edit a placed measurement directly on the drawing, dragging vertices and edges with the value updating live while the server re-derives the billed quantity. A new Save PDF button exports the marked-up drawing. Cost Benchmarks now compare a project against your own portfolio distribution by currency and show its percentile. File downloads are fixed so every file in a project downloads with your sign-in, including DWG and IFC, and the dashboard quick-upload gains a project picker.' },
  { version: '7.4.0', date: '2026-06-10', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'Takeoff measurements and markups now open the real drawing instead of an empty viewer, with the measurement or annotation in view. Every example project starts with real site photos, and the dashboard gains a latest-photos strip across projects. A new Point Cloud beta registers laser scan, photogrammetry and LIDAR clouds. Cost models, the change register, tenders, takeoff, accommodation, markups, the catalogue, BIM federations and clash now arrive filled with example data. The AI Estimate Builder no longer crashes when you confirm the parameter sheet.' },
  { version: '7.3.0', date: '2026-06-08', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'Grouping and filtering on uploaded IFC models in the BIM viewer line up with the geometry again and stay on the selection instead of snapping back to the whole model. The upload picker accepts RVT, IFC and DWG only, with DWG sent straight to the Drawings takeoff. A new schedule-quality pack adds seven checks for project schedules. Self-explaining modules arrive across the platform: confidence badges, suggestion chips, plain-language errors and an inline glossary in every language. Appending an asset maintenance log now checks project access first.' },
  { version: '7.2.0', date: '2026-06-08', tag: 'FIX',       summary: 'Fixes the Windows app that could get stuck on "Recovering the local database" on PCs set to the Turkish regional format, and heals a machine that was already stuck. The AI Estimate Builder no longer shows a fake $0.00 for an unpriced code, reads its parameters in plain words, shows a live progress bar and groups matched rates by trade. The BIM viewer filter and property-search panel is now translated in all 26 languages. Element matching can use your own AI key for better results. Module switching is faster, and the RVT converter and IFC filters work correctly again.' },
  { version: '7.1.0', date: '2026-06-07', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'Related records are now one click away everywhere: over 80 new links connect variations, change orders, contracts, clashes, inspections and more, in both directions. The AI Estimate Builder talks you through scope, shows editable work packages and explains why each rate was chosen. The desktop app sets itself up on first launch. About a thousand interface strings per language were brought to native copy in all 26 languages.' },
  { version: '7.0.1', date: '2026-06-06', tag: 'FIX',       summary: 'Fixes the Windows desktop app that could close on its own right after opening. It now shows a clear error if it cannot start, reuses a running backend only when versions match, and installs without needing a download.' },
  { version: '7.0.0', date: '2026-06-06', tag: 'MILESTONE', summary: 'New AI Estimate Builder turns a typed scope, a BIM model or uploaded files into a priced bill of quantities, with prices always from the cost catalogue. Every module now has one clean title in the top bar and a short card explaining what it does, in all 27 languages. The collaboration hub is a real workspace, and many modules got fixes so dashboards, validation and matching just work.' },
  { version: '6.10.0', date: '2026-06-05', tag: 'NEW',      summary: 'Field time tracking with real payroll: a crew lead logs hours, those hours flow into a payroll batch and post to the ledger exactly once. A new project-controls dashboard shows cost, schedule, quality, safety and risk health in one view. Owner billing forms for US, Canada and Australia. New subcontractor payment portal and client progress-reports tab.' },
  { version: '6.9.0', date: '2026-06-05', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'New screen for the Management of Change register. Cost matching works again for projects outside the US. Backup restore is now limited to your own data so it cannot wipe another user. Plus broad backend hardening and the desktop fixes from the 6.8 builds.' },
  { version: '6.8.2', date: '2026-06-05', tag: 'FIX',       summary: 'The Windows, macOS and Linux desktop installers build again, carrying the 6.8.1 database fix that had shipped on pip and Docker but not as an installer.' },
  { version: '6.8.1', date: '2026-06-05', tag: 'FIX',       summary: 'The desktop app now launches reliably after install. It connects to its own local database correctly and shows a clear message plus a startup log if anything goes wrong, instead of failing silently.' },
  { version: '6.8.0', date: '2026-06-04', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'Quantity takeoff on DWG drawings now reports correct real-world metres. A wave of features links the modules together, from subcontractor scorecards and progress claims to resource leveling and offline field work. Interface translation gaps cleared across all 26 non-English languages.' },
  { version: '6.7.0', date: '2026-06-03', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'All 27 interface languages are now fully translated. The AI Agents page adds ready-made agents and a no-code builder. Partner packs install cleanly with their catalogue and demo data. Example projects come filled out with real Revit, IFC and DWG models. Generated PDFs now render correctly in Cyrillic and other alphabets, and the desktop installers bundle the database engine so the app starts on a fresh machine.' },
  { version: '6.6.0', date: '2026-06-02', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'PostgreSQL is now the only database. The app still starts its own database on first run, or you can point it at an external one. Also fixes 3D models on the project map so geometry shows as soon as a model is placed.' },
  { version: '6.5.0', date: '2026-06-02', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'A redesigned AI Agents page with five new working agents: estimate review, cost classification, document search, cost summary and rate benchmarking. WhatsApp notifications. Placing a file on the project map works end to end with fast map tiles. The bill of quantities shows multiple currencies again, never blended.' },
  { version: '6.4.2', date: '2026-06-02', tag: 'FIX',       summary: 'Geometry fixes so BIM and 3D models sit at ground level. Partner Packs you can build and install by dropping a folder or uploading a zip, with no restart needed. Plus security dependency updates.' },
  { version: '6.4.1', date: '2026-06-02', tag: 'FIX',       summary: 'Build cleanup only. No change to how the app runs.' },
  { version: '6.4.0', date: '2026-06-02', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'Estimate, BOQ, budget, purchase orders, contracts and bid packages now share one cost line, with a rollup that shows estimate, budget, committed, contracted and actual figures next to every linked record. Amounts are grouped by currency and never blended. The project map now flies to a 3D model once it has loaded.' },
  { version: '6.3.1', date: '2026-06-01', tag: 'FIX',       summary: 'Fixes the project map page crash and restores 3D geometry. The dashboard schedule and AI-insights widgets now use real data, coming-soon teasers are gone, and the Daily Diary PDF plus PDF and AI quantity matching are real. Partner Pack activation installs the bundled cost catalogue with a live progress bar.' },
  { version: '6.3.0', date: '2026-06-01', tag: 'NEW',       summary: 'Nine role-based company profiles: pick one and the sidebar shows just the modules that role needs. The Partner Packs banner now opens the in-app packs page, plus a place-on-map picker on the project map page.' },
