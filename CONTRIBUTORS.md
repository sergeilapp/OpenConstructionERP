Thank you to everyone who has contributed.

- **skolodi** ([@skolodi](https://github.com/skolodi)): issue reports and field feedback
  on the BOQ AI assistant.
- **Mourtadha Diop** ([@Mourdi59](https://github.com/Mourdi59)): fixed three BIM viewer
  bugs ([#159](https://github.com/datadrivenconstruction/OpenConstructionERP/pull/159)),
  COLLADA namespace-prefix serialisation in `ifc_processor`, defence-in-depth regex
  tolerance in `ElementManager`, and `degraded` model status surfacing in the viewer UI.
- **rjohny** ([@rjohny55](https://github.com/rjohny55)): multi-area patch set
  ([#161](https://github.com/datadrivenconstruction/OpenConstructionERP/pull/161)),
  defensive guards for the slow-query SQLAlchemy listener and the module-presence probe
  under concurrency, a FieldReport activity-rollup column fix, Qdrant multipart snapshot
  upload so app-container snapshots reach a separate Qdrant container, and three new AI
  providers, Kimi (Moonshot AI), Ollama and vLLM, with custom base URL support for the
  two local backends.
- **Jehad Baniowda** ([@jehadbaniodeh](https://github.com/jehadbaniodeh)): fixed the
  production Docker deployment and the takeoff viewer. The backend image now installs its
  dependencies and starts correctly
  ([#173](https://github.com/datadrivenconstruction/OpenConstructionERP/pull/173)), nginx
  upgrades WebSocket connections so real-time notifications and presence work
  ([#176](https://github.com/datadrivenconstruction/OpenConstructionERP/pull/176)), `.mjs`
  workers are served with the correct MIME type so the PDF takeoff viewer renders
  ([#175](https://github.com/datadrivenconstruction/OpenConstructionERP/pull/175)), the
  upload ceiling is raised to 100M for PDF and CAD drawings
  ([#174](https://github.com/datadrivenconstruction/OpenConstructionERP/pull/174)), and
  takeoff documents open in the in-app viewer instead of a broken download navigation
  ([#172](https://github.com/datadrivenconstruction/OpenConstructionERP/pull/172)).
