# OpenConstructionERP - Roadmap Build State

> Single resumable control file. Any agent or fresh session resuming this work reads THIS file first, then `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. It records what we are building, the locked decisions, the hard constraints, the alembic chain, the dev environment, and exactly where we are. Keep the Status board and Progress log current as work proceeds.

## CURRENT STATE 2026-06-02 (v6.4.2 PUBLISHED; resume here)

Founder directive 2026-06-02: "do everything and run it. First lock in all the latest changes - make commits, publish versions, and write all progress and tasks so an agent can resume after a reboot." Then continue all remaining work autonomously. Dominant intent: "publish everything as the latest version to all platforms" - DONE for v6.4.2.

=== v6.4.2 PUBLISHED 2026-06-02 ===
Release commit `c53304c253128ca023688bb70eabfd44e7888596` on main. Annotated tag `v6.4.2` (tag-object ea1d6ef94, deref ^{commit} = c53304c25). Eight parallel agent lanes shipped + verified.
PUBLISHED + VERIFIED on all platforms:
- PyPI: 6.4.2 live (Build+Publish to PyPI = success; wheel openconstructionerp-6.4.2-py3-none-any.whl, 35.7MB, contains the real Vite build at app/_frontend_dist = 701 files / 288 hashed assets). NOTE: pypi.org's main /pypi/<pkg>/json endpoint lags on Fastly cache for a minute (showed "latest 6.4.1" right after publish); the per-version /6.4.2/json and files.pythonhosted.org serve it immediately - trust those.
- GitHub Release: v6.4.2 published (not draft/prerelease, body = CHANGELOG [6.4.2] section via release.yml awk; scanned 0 em-dashes / 0 AI mentions).
- Docker GHCR: Docker Build & Push = success.
- VPS https://openconstructionerp.com: live 6.4.2 (local 9090 + public via Caddy both: version 6.4.2, 117 modules, db ok, alembic_head_matches true). Deploy = detached `git checkout c53304c25`; pip installed ONLY itsdangerous-2.2.0 + simpleeval-1.0.7 (the sole net-new deps; pyarrow already 24.0.0 and python-multipart already 0.0.29 both satisfied the bumped floors, so ZERO disk pressure at 98% full); frontend swapped in from the wheel's app/_frontend_dist (canonical parity, old 6.4.0 build kept at backend/app/_frontend_dist_prev as rollback); restart; boot ~3-4 min (SentenceTransformer/vector-DB load on CPU-only, normal). DB untouched (6.4.2 adds NO migration; the v3145 file diff vs v6.4.0 was a ruff reformat, no DDL).
- Desktop installers: Build Desktop (mac/ubuntu/win) in_progress at publish time; Build Sidecar all 3 = success. Full installers still #27 (~2-3d macOS CI).
CI on the release commit c53304c25 (unauth check-runs API): GREEN = PyPI, Docker, GitHub Release, backend-postgres, build (the production Vite build), Version Sync, CodeQL, Scorecard, deploy. RED = Frontend CI (the vitest unit-test job, see #50 below) + Release Please (chronic, bypassed). Backend CI was in_progress (collection-clean fix bc1c18435 + the importorskip guards; expect exit 1 exposing genuine IDOR-403-vs-404 failures, needs gh auth to read).
Release commits (all ancestors of c53304c25): bc1c18435 backend collection-clean; 14ae5b6ce fix(deps) multipart/pyarrow/uuid + itsdangerous/simpleeval BASE deps; 11c6570f5 fix(desktop) externalBin flat-path + fail-fast; dcc7975cd docs CHANGELOG+release-notes+partner-pack docs; then the 6.4.1->6.4.2 version bump (pyproject/package.json/package-lock x2/tauri.conf + Changelog.tsx top entry) => c53304c25.
VERIFIED earlier this session: partner-pack create->drop->activate E2E ALL PASS, zero code changes (#52 done, robust).
DEPLOY GOTCHA LEARNED: the VPS `git fetch` of a release delta is SLOW (~2 min). Do NOT bundle fetch+checkout+pip+frontend+restart AND a long health-poll loop in one SSH call - the Bash tool's 2-min timeout kills it mid-run (the fetch completes so the objects land, but checkout never runs; re-running with the commit already fetched is instant). Run the deploy steps as ONE ssh call (no health loop), then poll health in a SEPARATE call with a patient ~3-4 min window (the SentenceTransformer load delays first response).
#14 "setup-report PDF" = PHANTOM: no such feature in the repo, stale v6.2.5-era label; leading guess property_dev/document_templates.py (11 generators). Needs the founder to paste the 11 items.

PUBLISHED NOW:
- v6.4.0 = the product release (cost spine, CLI module install, geo auto-framing). GitHub tag v6.4.0 (deref ^{commit}=a810f2f36), PyPI 6.4.0, GitHub Release, VPS live 6.4.0 (alembic v3151). Details in the v6.4.0 block below.
- v6.4.1 = lint/CI-hygiene checkpoint (THIS commit). GitHub main 37f4d5ef8 / tag v6.4.1 (annotated; deref ^{commit}=37f4d5ef8). Tag pushed so PyPI + GitHub Release CI is running - verify PyPI shows 6.4.1. Contents: backend lint/format only (143a65998 ruff check fix, edcd7a751 ruff format + pin ruff==0.15.14, 37f4d5ef8 version bump). Runtime-identical to 6.4.0, so the VPS does NOT need a redeploy.

WHAT I JUST DID + CONFIRMED: cleared the backend lint job's two ruff gates (red on ruff since before v6.3.0). Proof it works in CI: the Backend CI run on edcd7a751 now exits code 3, which is pytest's internal-error code, so the job got PAST both ruff steps. The demo_pack BOQ data tables are format-excluded (`[tool.ruff.format] exclude=["app/core/demo_packs/*-*.py"]`) so the formatter does not explode their readable one-row-per-line layout. Formatting is AST-preserving (verified), no behaviour change.

CONTINUATION 2026-06-02 (later): founder added three asks - (a) credit GitHub user jehadbaniodeh as a contributor, (b) launch more agents and work everything remaining better, (c) review and close all open issues/questions from the last ~2 days. Done so far:
- FRONTEND CI: the "Frontend CI" redness was NOT a vitest 2->4 migration (main IS on 2.1.9; the earlier note here was wrong). It was a batch of STALE unit tests that drifted from their components. All fixed and pushed on commit 94bb7347b (13 files, 108 tests pass locally together, 0 component regressions found). Fixes: CesiumViewer stub missing cesium exports the viewer now reads (SceneMode/Resource/Cesium3DTileStyle/BoundingSphere) + Resource-based fromUrl + deterministic empty-mock for the absent test; 9 file-module tests whose own react-i18next mock omitted initReactI18next (which made app/i18n.ts throw on import); compliance create-modal stale data-testid; bulk-delete test migrated to the recycle-bin softDelete api; cost-database-search region-auto-default timing race (added settle-waits); 2 stale visual-regression snapshots (WCAG contrast text-oe-blue->text-oe-blue-text + new dashboard ops card) regenerated and the dashboard test clock pinned. Background poller bclvxy1dm is confirming Frontend CI goes green on 94bb7347b. Task #50.
- CONTRIBUTOR jehadbaniodeh: was in CONTRIBUTORS.md text but had no author-attributed commit (unlike skolodi/rjohny/Mourtadha), so absent from the GitHub contributor graph. Fixed by commit 8829e1975 which adds deploy/docker/README.md (accurate doc of HIS Docker/nginx work: unified+split images, 100M uploads, .mjs MIME, WebSocket upgrade) authored as "Jehad Baniowda <57659952+jehadbaniodeh@users.noreply.github.com>", committer DDC. Pushed. Task #51.
- ISSUES/PRs (triaged read-only via unauth GitHub API): 0 open true issues. All 15 open items are PRs: 5 from jehadbaniodeh (#172-176) are ALL already shipped in v6.4.0 (their nginx.conf/Dockerfile.backend/takeoff fixes are in the tree) and just need a thank-you close; 10 are Dependabot bumps (#169, #177-185) needing a maintainer decision - several are majors tied to CI: vitest 2->4 (#184 supersedes #177), vite 6->8 (#185 supersedes #178), tailwind v4 (#181), react-router v7 (#182), node 20->26 (#179), and ruff #183 which would undo the v6.4.1 ruff==0.15.14 pin. Do NOT blind-merge the majors. BLOCKER: `gh` is NOT authenticated, so closing the 5 PRs + posting replies and merging/closing dependabot all require the founder to run `gh auth login` first. A DDC-voice thank-you reply for the 5 PRs is drafted (in the session triage output).

CONTINUATION 2026-06-02 (post-compaction, autonomous): more work landed and is committed.
- BACKEND CI exit-3 ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED (this SUPERSEDES item 1's OOM hypothesis below). The exit-3 was a pytest COLLECTION crash, not OOM: an investigation agent refuted OOM (engine create/dispose balanced ~166/175, RSS flat ~400-720 MB, and exit 3 != 137). Real cause: optional-dependency code calling sys.exit at import during collection - chiefly qdrant_client (sys.exit(2)) - plus test modules importing celery / pypdf / jsonschema / pymupdf at load time, none of which are in the CI `.[dev]` install. Fixed with pytest.importorskip guards. Commits: 81109a100 (celery x2 + pypdf + jsonschema + inline qdrant), cc2f85190 (qdrant in build_enriched_snapshot test), 4fb634d89 (pymupdf in test_match_elements_pdf_source). One was a genuine failing test, not a guard: 319b55e9a fixed test_ai_client (added base_url=None to the fake, split provider-resolution into non-Anthropic vs Anthropic-alias). Expect Backend CI to move exit 3 -> exit 1, exposing the remaining GENUINE failures to fix once `gh auth login` lets us read the runner: (a) IDOR 403-vs-404 expectations in test_property_dev_document_templates, (b) aiosqlite "await wasn't used with future" (likely Windows-only, may not reproduce on Linux CI). Memory teardown was a red herring.
- IFC #53 SHIPPED (commit e6b022a63, task #53 done): _extract_placements gained length_scale and rescales IfcCartesianPoint coords (3D + 2D), so mm / imperial models sit at ground instead of km off-origin; 3 regression tests in test_ifc_geometry_unit_scaling.py.
- PARTNER-PACK DROP-IN SHIPPED (task #52, "create -> drop in a folder -> activate"): backend 186c1dc9f adds <data_dir>/packs/ discovery + POST /api/v1/partner-pack/install upload (admin, 25 MiB, magic-byte gate) + shared _safe_extract.py (Zip-Slip hardened, double-validated, staged extract; security-reviewed) + CLI `pack new <slug>` scaffolder; frontend 9e834d7ca adds the admin-gated InstallPackPanel (dropzone + Rescan) on Modules -> Partner Packs and rewrote the developer guide #partner-packs (can/cannot, real manifest.json, drop-or-upload + Rescan + Apply, no "restart the backend"). Plus fingerprint ASCII fix db5a27fe8 and 2 stale frontend tests 156cbde6e. REMAINING for #52: run the create->drop->activate E2E against a CURRENT-code backend (the local dev backend is stale 6.1.2, so its API predates this).
- DEV-ENV + LOCALHOST FIX: the local dev backend is stale 6.1.2 on :8080 while the frontend source is current 6.4.2. Vite's `/api` proxy defaults to :8000 but `openconstructionerp serve` defaults to :8080, so demo-login failed ("Demo login failed"). Fixed for now by relaunching Vite with VITE_API_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:8080 (demo-login verified 200 + access/refresh tokens through the :5173 proxy). PROPER fix: either make `serve` default to 8000 (matches vite + the README uvicorn quickstart) or document the override; to exercise current features locally, restart the backend on current code on :8000 (embedded PG - mind the recovery-timeout gotcha).
- HARD RULE confirmed: NEVER run the full backend pytest suite locally - each test builds the full app + embedded PG, it pins the CPU and was the source of the founder's "Request timed out" reports. Read failures from GitHub CI's runner instead.

STILL OPEN (founder-authorized):
1. Backend CI: now expected at exit 1 (collection crash fixed above). NEXT once `gh auth login` is available: read the run, fix the genuine failures (IDOR 403-vs-404 in test_property_dev_document_templates; aiosqlite await-future if it reproduces on Linux), no masking. (The OLD OOM hypothesis here was refuted - kept for history: full backend pytest hit 12 GB RSS at ~4% after ~62 min locally, but that is single-process local accumulation, not the CI exit-3 cause.)
2. Close the 5 jehad PRs (#172-176) with the thank-you reply + decide the 10 dependabot PRs - needs `gh auth login`.
3. Desktop Release (task #27) + Release Please: chronic, separate.
4. Product: #48 geo b3dm vertical-georeferencing data fix; #45 roadmap features 06/07/08; optional broad user-facing em-dash sweep.

HARD GOTCHAS (still apply): push by explicit SHA refspec `git push origin $(git rev-parse HEAD):refs/heads/main` then verify with `git ls-remote` (a plain push can silently no-op); tags are annotated, compare `vX.Y.Z^{commit}` not the tag-object SHA; `gh` is NOT authenticated; NO em-dashes and NO Claude/AI attribution in any GitHub text; the VPS app runs from a git checkout at a detached release SHA on port 9090 behind Caddy (deploy = checkout the SHA + pip-install any new deps + ship a fresh _frontend_dist by tar-over-ssh + alembic upgrade head + restart openconstructionerp), disk is 98% so do NOT build the frontend on the VPS; money is converted within a project via fx_rates and grouped by ISO currency across projects, never blended, Decimal-as-string; embedded PG has quirks (recovery timeout, kill the supervising bash before the python); do NOT `git reset --hard` / `git stash` / `git clean` (scratch `_*` files and diagnostics live in the tree).

## LIVE RUN STATUS (2026-06-01, autonomous long run)

Founder directive: work continuously, implement everything so all modules work together on the PostgreSQL foundation, run full E2E (real clicks, screenshots, logic verification) at the end, then publish ONCE as a new version (target v6.4.0). Do not publish intermediate versions.

=== v6.4.0 PUBLISHED 2026-06-02 (run complete) ===
GitHub main a810f2f36 / tag v6.4.0 (deref ^{commit}=a810f2f36). PyPI 6.4.0 live. GitHub Release published. VPS https://openconstructionerp.com live on 6.4.0 (117 modules, db ok, alembic v3151 head-matches, SQLite 2.7G, boot ~194s).

Shipped in v6.4.0: cost spine keystone (feature 01: ControlAccount + CostLine, FX rollups grouped by currency never blended, idempotent generate-from-BOQ; alembic v3150->v3151; 28 SQLite tests + PG lane + E2E green); CLI module install/list/uninstall (real partner-pack install); geo 3D auto-framing fix (CesiumViewer: auto-zoom awaits tileset readyPromise + fitToData frames the tileset sphere ALONE instead of unioning the sea-level anchor - verified camera settles at 2.92 sphere-radii = FRAMED).

Full E2E result: 13/13 flows PASS, 0 functional bugs (dashboard, geo 3D, cost spine generate/rollup/idempotent, partner-packs guide+activate, 8-module smoke).

Deferred to v6.5 (tasked): geo b3dm vertical-georeferencing data fix (models float 5-9km above ground; viewer frames them but the offset is wrong at ingest) = task #48. Broad user-facing em-dash sweep = optional. Roadmap features 06/07/08 = next.

Known PRE-EXISTING red CI (NOT a v6.4.0 regression; red since v6.3.0 59b5e9b9): Backend ruff (50 errors, 20 N999 hyphenated demo_pack filenames + import nits, none in costmodel) + Frontend vitest (dependabot 2.1.9->4.1.0 major unreconciled). Passing: CI(PostgreSQL), CodeQL, OpenSSF, PyPI Publish, Release. CI repair tasked = #49. Desktop Release fails = known-broken installers #27.

WORKING TREE WARNING: a large uncommitted changeset is on disk (accumulated 6.3.x fixes plus this run's work). DO NOT `git reset --hard`, `git stash`, or `git clean` - that destroys hours of work (see memory `zombie_bg_task_stash_pop`). Commit at clean milestones; tag/publish only at the very end. New untracked source that MUST be committed at milestone: `backend/openconstructionerp/` (launcher), `backend/app/modules/daily_diary/pdf_export.py`, `backend/app/modules/match_elements/{matchers/llm.py,pdf_import.py,sources/pdf_adapter.py}`, new tests under `backend/tests/`, `frontend/src/features/geo-hub/__tests__/`, `docs/strategy/`. Exclude scratch: `_*`, `_flagship/`, `_frontend_dist_prev/`, `*.txt`, `HANDOVER_NEW_AGENT.md`.

DONE + VERIFIED this run:
- Login SQLite write-lock fix (`users/service.py`): `last_login_at` written in the request session, not a detached `asyncio` task that opened a second connection and locked the next request. Verified: match 20/20, demo-login 6/6, auth-timing 1/1; demo-login confirmed on embedded PG.
- Geo 3D model + overlay fix: NEW backend route `GET /api/v1/geo-hub/tilesets/{id}/artifact/{filename}` streams `tileset.json` + tiles (`geo_hub/service.py:get_tileset_artifact_bytes`, `router.py`). Frontend loads tileset + raster through a Cesium `Resource` carrying the bearer token (`CesiumViewer.tsx`, `OverlayLayer.tsx`, `api.ts:geoAuthHeaders/tilesetArtifactUrl`). Root cause: the DB stored a bare storage key with no serving route, so Cesium got `index.html` back; rasters/tilesets also lacked auth. Verified on real Houston tileset `d346a4b2`: `tileset.json` 200 JSON, `tile_0.b3dm` 200 5.58MB, 401 no-token, 404 traversal. Frontend rebuilt + mirrored to `_frontend_dist`.
- Top-menu Documentation link -> `https://openconstructionerp.com/docs` (`Header.tsx`), live 200.
- `backend/README.md` stale "SQLite" -> embedded PostgreSQL; branded `python -m openconstructionerp` launcher.
- Version files currently at 6.3.1; re-bump to 6.4.0 at the end.

PG base: dedicated `tests/pg` lane green (19 passed) on embedded PostgreSQL - safe to build on.

Partner-packs investigation (agent, complete): the activate flow works end to end and is fail-soft, and the SSE step contract matches the dialog. Problems found: BLOCKER the developer guide documents `openestimate module install <zip>` but no `module` CLI subcommand exists; MAJOR stale "v4.3 / 110+ modules" claim in the guide; MAJOR resources-count shows 0 on already-loaded cost regions (already-loaded branch of load_cwicr_region omits resource_components); MINOR genuine em-dashes in shipped pack/demo strings; MINOR the i18n-fallbacks instruction points at the test-only file.

DONE this run (partner-packs):
- BLOCKER resolved by implementation: real `module install`/`list`/`uninstall` CLI in backend/app/cli.py (static ast manifest parse - never executes untrusted code, rejects path traversal/absolute/drive-letter/symlink/multi-top-dir, atomic move into app/modules/<dir> where dir = name.removeprefix("oe_")). Both `openconstructionerp` and `openestimate` console scripts work; canonical is `openconstructionerp module install <zip>`. Verified live against malicious archives + happy path, nothing left in repo.
- MAJOR resources-count fix: costs/router.py load_cwicr_region already-loaded branch now returns true `resource_components` (dialect-portable json_array_length/jsonb_array_length sum), so the partner-pack installer progress + summary stop reporting 0 on already-loaded regions.
- MINOR em-dash purge: 489 genuine U+2014 replaced with hyphens in the REAL user-facing demo content (backend/app/core/demo_projects.py + backend/app/core/demo_packs/*.py, 20 files, accents preserved, py_compile clean). NOTE: there is no backend/app/core/partner_pack/packs/<slug>/manifest.py tree (that path only exists in the stale _frontend_dist_prev bundle); the prior investigation's pack-manifest em-dash locations were a false lead. 168 U+2014 remain in backend/app/core/partner_pack/*.py but are all developer-facing (comments/docstrings/log) - left intentionally.

DONE this run (guide text + cost-spine backend):
- Guide text + en.ts: CLI command -> canonical `openconstructionerp` brand; stale "v4.3 / 110+ modules" dropped (en.ts:2286 + TSX); i18n guidance corrected to locales/en + inline defaultValue (en.ts:2350/2359 + TSX); ModuleDeveloperGuide.tsx swept em-dash-free (44 more replaced). Frontend tsc exit 0 GREEN - after also fixing my own geo type gap: `CesiumLike` was missing `Resource` (my geo fix used `new cesium.Resource(...)`); added the Resource ctor + widened Cesium3DTileset.fromUrl to `string|object` in CesiumViewer.tsx (runtime always worked since esbuild strips types).
- v6.4 feature 01 cost spine BACKEND complete + self-verified: ControlAccount + CostLine in costmodel; 7 additive linkage columns (boq.Position, procurement PO item + req item, contracts.ContractLine, rfq.cost_line_ids JSON, budget_line cost_line_id + control_account_id); migration v3151_cost_spine off v3150_file_favorites; CostSpineService (generate_from_boq idempotent fill-nulls + write-back onto positions + auto-link budget lines by boq_position_id; rollup_for_project/line; CRUD with 409 guards; link/unlink); 3 repos incl. CostSpineRepository's 4 one-query FX-aware grouped aggregates (budget; po filtered issued/partially_received/completed; contract Decimal->str coercion; claimed = max-cumulative per (cost_line, contract_line) summed, to avoid double-counting interim claims); 12 endpoints with verify_project_access -> 404 cross-tenant. Self-verified: create_all has all 7 cols, 16 /spine/ OpenAPI paths, alembic up/down/up roundtrip schema-equal both ways. Index-name deviation documented as non-colliding (create_all+pg_optimizations vs migration paths never coexist).

DONE this run: Cost-spine FRONTEND complete + verified: api.ts (6 spine methods + 9 TS interfaces, rollup money typed `string`), 4 components (CostSpinePanel grid with per-account subtotals + a mixed-currency banner that suppresses the blended total; ControlAccountTree; GenerateSpineButton; CostLineRollupDrawer), new Cost Spine section in FiveDDashboard (CostModelPage.tsx, dashboard sections end ~line 2363), 36 costmodel.spine.* keys in en.ts. tsc 0 errors, vitest 6/6, ESLint clean, no em-dashes. (Pre-existing em-dash at CostModelPage.tsx:1861 noted for the sweep.)

IN FLIGHT: Cost-spine TESTS (the LAST in-flight piece; the backend correctness gate): unit (exact Decimal asserts, idempotency, 409s, rollup+FX, mixed_currency) + integration (BOQ->budget->spine->PO->contract flow + IDOR 404) + roundtrip-list append + tests/pg (JSONB + grouped aggregates); runs on SQLite AND the PG lane; fixes root-cause bugs without weakening tests; reports every fix.

E2E TOOLING confirmed for the end-of-run full E2E: frontend/playwright.config.ts + e2e/ + tests/e2e/ + a smoke/ suite; package.json scripts test:e2e (playwright test), test:e2e:smoke, test:e2e:headed; @playwright/test + @axe-core/playwright installed. :8000 dev server alive (health: 6.3.1, 117 modules, database ok, frontend_dist_present; alembic_head_matches=false so status="degraded" - expected on the v6live dev DB, not a real problem). BEFORE E2E: rebuild frontend dist (cost-spine UI + guide text + CesiumLike fix) -> re-mirror to backend/app/_frontend_dist -> RESTART :8000 to load the cost-spine backend (kill ONLY the --port 8000 uvicorn python, keep postgres.exe so boot() reuses the cluster) -> confirm the v6live DB picked up the new costmodel tables via create_all on boot.

ENV NOTE: the Glob tool is unreliable in this session (uv_spawn errors and false "No files found" for files that exist) - use Bash `ls`/Grep for file-existence checks.

MILESTONE COMMITTED (local only, NO tag/push yet): main 27e6ad03b "feat: cost spine keystone, real module install, geo and login fixes" (122 files, +17016/-1026). Includes cost spine (backend+frontend+tests), partner-packs CLI+resources+em-dash+guide, geo+login+doc-link fixes, the CesiumLike type fix, plus the accumulated prior-session module work + docs/strategy. Working tree now clean of tracked changes; only scratch remains untracked (_*, _flagship/, _pr_review/, _frontend_dist_prev/, HANDOVER_NEW_AGENT.md). _frontend_dist is gitignored (the wheel build bundles it at publish; I rebuilt + mirrored it so :8000 serves the new UI).

:8000 RESTARTED on the new code: confirmed embedded PostgreSQL ("PostgreSQL tables created/verified"), 117 modules, db ok. create_all made the 2 new cost-spine tables but NOT the 7 linkage columns on existing tables.

DONE: DB-ops applied v3151 to the live v6live PG via alembic stamp v3150 + upgrade head (embedded cluster port 58487; all 7 columns + 2 tables + 6 linkage indexes present; alembic_version=v3151_cost_spine; the server now reports status=healthy + alembic_head_matches=true as a bonus). Smoke on the Montreal demo project (129 priced CAD positions): generate-from-boq HTTP 200 (107 accounts, 129 cost lines, 129 positions linked, 0 budget lines linked), rollup HTTP 200 (CAD, estimate 46,367,110.00). NOTE for E2E: that smoke ran generate TWICE, so the Montreal project now has ~258 cost lines (duplicates) - for a clean cost-spine E2E use a DIFFERENT demo project that has a BOQ but no spine yet, or delete Montreal's cost lines and regenerate after the fix below.

BUG FOUND (fixing): generate-from-boq is NOT idempotent for BOQ positions WITHOUT reference_code - each re-run creates a fresh batch of cost lines (Montreal 129 -> 258) because the dedup key is the cost-line `code`, which is a random CL-XXXX for unreferenced positions. Accounts dedup fine (stable classification code). The tests' idempotency coverage used referenced positions, missing this common case.

DONE: idempotency fix COMMITTED (main 4a0dd5953) - generate-from-boq now dedups BOQ-sourced lines by boq_position_id (new CostLineRepository.existing_by_boq_position), reuse-or-create, preserving the snapshot/account-dedup/currency/write-back/budget-autolink behavior. Tests: SQLite unit 18 + integration 10, PG lane 11 (added unreferenced-position re-run regression guards on all three lanes). :8000 RESTARTED on the fixed code (instance 779418c0, healthy, alembic_head_matches true, db ok, 117 modules).

Commits so far this run: 27e6ad03b (milestone) -> 4a0dd5953 (idempotency fix). HEAD = 4a0dd5953. No tag/push yet.

IN FLIGHT: comprehensive E2E agent (Playwright vs :8000 built dist, sequential, real clicks + screenshots to backend/_e2e_shots/): login (demo-login gated off, so real UI login or JWT inject), geo (the reported 3D/DWG/PDF map-visibility bug), cost spine (generate + rollup + idempotent re-run on a CLEAN project, explicitly NOT Montreal), partner-packs guide+list, broad module smoke; returns a ranked findings list.

NEXT: review E2E findings + eyeball the geo + cost-spine screenshots (Read the image files) -> fix anything surfaced -> bump 6.4.0 across pyproject.toml/package.json/tauri.conf.json/CHANGELOG.md/Changelog.tsx + rebuild dist + re-mirror -> commit + tag v6.4.0 + push by SHA refspec + PyPI + GitHub release + VPS deploy, as ONE release at the very end.

NEXT: full E2E (Playwright, real clicks + screenshots + logic) covering geo (the reported 3D/DWG/PDF map-visibility bug), partner-packs (guide + install), cost spine (generate + rollup), and a broad module smoke -> fix anything E2E surfaces -> bump 6.4.0 + finalize CHANGELOG / Changelog.tsx -> commit + tag v6.4.0 + push by explicit SHA refspec + PyPI + GitHub release + VPS deploy, as ONE release at the very end. Optional if time allows: the broad user-facing em-dash sweep TODO above.

TODO (later phase, do NOT start while costmodel/boq/procurement/contracts/rfq or ModuleDeveloperGuide.tsx/en.ts are being edited): broad user-facing em-dash sweep across the rest of the app (other backend modules' data string literals + all frontend locale files + components), since demo content alone held 489 - the codebase likely has more user-facing em-dashes elsewhere.

NEXT: review cost-spine backend -> launch its frontend + tests (PG-verified) -> then features 06/07/08 (write specs first, build sequentially to respect the linear alembic chain) -> cross-module integration pass -> full E2E (real clicks, screenshots, logic) -> bump 6.4.0 -> commit/tag/PyPI/GitHub/VPS. Maximal fidelity; complete each feature to standard; be transparent about completed vs deferred rather than half-building several.

DEV ENV: backend `:8000` = `python -m app.cli serve --data-dir C:/Users/Artem Boiko/.openestimate-v6live --port 8000` on embedded PostgreSQL (PID changes on restart; relaunched this run, not 16820). Frontend vite dev on `:5173`. Anaconda python: `/c/Users/Artem Boiko/anaconda3/python` (has pytest + the pip-installed package). Restart `:8000`: kill ONLY the uvicorn python (CommandLine matches `--port 8000`), leave `postgres.exe` alive so `boot()` reuses the cluster, then verify `/api/health` shows `database: ok`. Frontend changes: `npm run build` in `frontend/`, then robocopy `/MIR frontend/dist -> backend/app/_frontend_dist` (StaticFiles serves per-request; no restart for assets, but backend code changes DO need a restart).

## What we are building

The nine connective-tissue features from the competitive analysis (benchmarked against Nevaris, iTWO, Autodesk Construction Cloud, Procore). The theme: we already own the modules, the differentiated work is connecting them into one system of record, not adding more modules. Two facts from our own code prove it: `approval_routes` is a built generic approval engine that no module imports yet, and `contracts` already carries ProgressClaim / Schedule of Values / retention models that are not surfaced in any UI.

## Read these, in order

1. This file (state, constraints, dev environment).
2. `docs/strategy/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (master plan: sequence, releases, per-feature step lists, alembic chain, consolidated test strategy, risks).
3. `docs/strategy/impl/NN-*.md` (deep design per feature, grounded in real code with cited file paths).
4. `docs/strategy/COMPETITIVE_FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md` (the why and the positioning).
5. `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (project identity and module conventions).

## Locked decisions (2026-06-01)

1. Execution order: dependency order. Cost spine (01) first, then the financial stack, the three independent features (06, 07, 08) in parallel, synthesis surfaces (09) last.
2. Release cadence: incremental. Shippable, browser-verified releases (v6.4, v6.5 and onward), grouped by dependency.
3. Depth per feature: maximal fidelity on the first pass. Each feature is built through all its phases to full standards-compliance before it is done. No MVP slice that defers the rest.
4. Region focus: region-neutral core plus partner packs. US AIA, DACH DIN, UK JCT behaviour layered through the partner-pack entry-point mechanism, never branched into core.

## Release grouping

| Release | Features | Full-fidelity effort |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| v6.4 | 01 cost spine (keystone) + 06 submittals/RFI + 07 version compare + 08 field PWA (06/07/08 parallel, independent of 01) | 01:13d, 06:11d, 07:17d, 08:20d |
| v6.5 | 02 payment applications + 03 budget cockpit (both depend on 01 only, parallel) | 02:23d, 03:21d |
| v6.6 | 04 auto EVM + 05 5D cockpit | 04:19d, 05:18d |
| v6.7 | 09 AI assistant + controls dashboard, plus remaining depth | 09:22d |

Calendar time per release is the longest parallel lane plus its review and verification, not the sum.

## Dependency graph

```
01 cost spine (no deps, keystone)
  -> 02 pay apps, 03 budget cockpit, 05 5D cockpit (each needs 01 only)
       -> 04 auto EVM (needs 01 and 03)
            -> 09 AI + controls (needs 01, 03, 04)
independent from day one: 06 submittals/RFI, 07 version compare, 08 field PWA
```

## Alembic chain (assigned, linear, from plan section 6)

Four designs independently proposed `v3151`. The plan assigns one linear chain. Use the assigned id, not the design-doc placeholder. Verify `alembic heads` at build time, never hardcode against a stale head.

```
v3150_file_favorites            (current head, do not touch)
  -> v3151_cost_spine                  (01)
  -> v3152_doc_links                   (06 Phase 2)
  -> v3153_payment_applications        (02)
  -> v3154_drawing_version_compare     (07)
  -> v3155_budget_cockpit              (03)
  -> <next free id> auto_evm_init      (04)
  -> <next free id> field_pwa_sync     (08)
  -> <next free id> project_controls   (09)
```

If two features are in flight at once, the second to merge rebases its down_revision onto the first's head and renumbers so the chain stays linear. Every migration keeps the idempotent guard pattern from `v3150_file_favorites` (`_table_exists`, `_index_exists`, `_column_exists`), every column add carries a `server_default`, and every new model table is added to the pre-`create_all` import list in `app/main.py` (a fresh SQLite install runs `Base.metadata.create_all` before alembic).

## Hard constraints (non-negotiable)

- No em-dashes anywhere (UI strings, docs, commits, releases, issues). Hyphens, commas, periods only.
- No IfcOpenShell and no native IFC parsing. BIM and CAD data only through the DDC cad2data canonical format. BCF is allowed as an I/O format.
- Money: convert within a project via `fx_rates`; group by ISO currency code across projects; never blend mixed currencies into one scalar; keep a missing-rate amount in its own units and surface the code with a mixed_currency flag; Decimal in, Decimal-as-string out; reuse the shared `_amount_in_base` / `_portfolio_money_breakdown` helpers, never invent FX math.
- No stubs or placeholders. Every shipped slice is a real working vertical: a control with no backend, a hard-coded zero, or a flag-gated empty feature is a failed phase.
- IDOR: every endpoint resolves the owning project and calls `verify_project_access` (field PWA reads project_id from the pinned session); return 404, never 403, on a cross-tenant miss.
- Event subscribers are idempotent against re-delivery, open their own `async_session_factory` session, and swallow failures so they never roll back the upstream transaction.
- Module conventions (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`): models, schemas, repository, service, router, tests. Permissions registered on startup. Router auto-mounted at `/api/v1/{module}/`.
- GitHub text and commits: DataDrivenConstruction voice, human prose, few lists, no AI or Claude attribution, no em-dashes. Commit and push only when the founder asks. Push by explicit SHA refspec `$(git rev-parse HEAD):refs/heads/main`, verify with `git ls-remote`.
- Frontend: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (strict mode on); co-located vitest; new user-facing strings via i18n translated into all 26 non-English locales (i18n-sweep skill).
- Email: only `info@datadrivenconstruction.io`.

## How to build one feature

1. Read its `docs/strategy/impl/NN-*.md` design.
2. Backend: models, then migration (assigned id, idempotent guards, server defaults, add table to `app/main.py` pre-create_all import), then schemas, repository, service, router (RBAC + `verify_project_access`), permissions on startup.
3. Backend tests: per-module temp SQLite set before any `from app...` import; exact Decimal asserts on money; an IDOR-404 case; alembic round-trip added to `tests/integration/test_migrations_roundtrip.py`.
4. Frontend: feature folder, api client, components, route and sidebar wiring (`ROUTE_MODULE_KEY` then `isModuleEnabled`).
5. Frontend vitest plus `tsc --noEmit` clean.
6. Browser verify on :8000, sequentially (never parallel against a shared server), including a `?lang=de` pass that leaks no raw i18n keys.
7. Adversarial review against the design and these constraints before the feature is called done.

## Dev environment

- :8000 dev server (founder tests here): anaconda python `-m app.cli serve --data-dir "C:/Users/Artem Boiko/.openestimate-v6live" --port 8000`. Embedded PostgreSQL, serves the built bundle in `backend/app/_frontend_dist` (not the vite source), no `--reload` so a backend code change needs a restart. Health at `/api/health` (reports version, module count, `alembic_head_matches`).
- Backend tests: anaconda python `"/c/Users/Artem Boiko/anaconda3/python" -m pytest <file>` run from `backend/`. Run each integration test file in its own process (the per-module temp-sqlite env is set at import, so two integration files in one process collide).
- Frontend build: `cd frontend && npm run build`, then mirror `frontend/dist` into `backend/app/_frontend_dist` (robocopy /MIR, keep `_frontend_dist_prev`), then restart :8000.
- ruff: 0.15.14, line-length 120, select E,F,W,I,N,UP,ANN,B,A,COM,C4,PT,RET,SIM,ARG. Ruff-check only the files you changed, the wider tree has pre-existing lint.
- VPS deploy: by tag, mirror the prebuilt dist, restart the `openconstructionerp` systemd unit. Never build the frontend on the VPS (disk near full). App listens on port 9090 behind Caddy. Use the 4-slash absolute `DATABASE_SYNC_URL` for alembic on the VPS.

## Status board

Base: v6.3.1 (geo crash fix + 3D geometry, schedule-summary and AI-insights widget endpoints, real multi-year calendars, removed coming-soon teasers, real Daily Diary PDF, match_elements PDF source + LLM matcher + split/merge + RFQ wire-up, partner-pack activate installs catalog + resources with a streamed progress bar, Jehad's takeoff/Docker/nginx fixes). Status: in final verification, not yet committed or published.

| ID | Feature | Release | Status | Branch/worktree | Notes |

| - | v6.3.1 base | - | in verification | main (uncommitted) | tsc + vitest green; backend tests running |
| 01 | Cost spine | v6.4 | not started | - | keystone, build first and verify before 02/03/05 |
| 06 | Submittals/RFI via approval_routes | v6.4 | not started | - | independent, mostly activation |
| 07 | Drawing version compare | v6.4 | not started | - | independent |
| 08 | Field PWA | v6.4 | not started | - | independent |
| 02 | Payment applications | v6.5 | not started | - | needs 01 |
| 03 | Budget cockpit | v6.5 | not started | - | needs 01 |

## Progress log

- 2026-06-01: Competitive analysis, master implementation plan, and nine deep design docs written. Four decisions locked (dependency order, incremental releases, maximal fidelity, region-neutral plus packs). v6.3.1 in final verification as the clean base. Build of v6.4 starts on the committed v6.3.1 base, keystone 01 first.

## Next concrete action

1. Finish v6.3.1 verification (await backend test run), build the frontend, mirror dist, browser-verify on :8000.
2. Bump 6.3.0 to 6.3.1 in `backend/pyproject.toml` and `frontend/package.json` (and Changelog), commit in DataDrivenConstruction voice, push by SHA refspec, tag `v6.3.1` (triggers PyPI and GitHub release), deploy to VPS by tag.
3. On the committed v6.3.1 base, launch the v6.4 build: feature 01 (cost spine) carefully and verified first, with features 06, 07, 08 in parallel worktrees. Update the Status board and Progress log as each lane lands.
